~~Identification can be a tricky thing, sometimes. For simplicity, let's say I am a web-developer. I like playing
around with technology and anything new, really. I am curious about a lot of things which includes life's biggest
questions. That takes me to philosophical areas, which I find very interesting. Admittedly, I don't find many people truly interested in those kinds of stuff; So, I often keep my thoughts to myself or sometimes write about them - some of them are here, on this website.~~

I have asked and re-asked this question to myself, who/what am I? This isn't a simple question to me. It's philosophical and existential.

In short, I've found the answer - mostly intellectually and experientially in few occasions. And I have memories and some intuitive understanding of those experiences, hence the answer. Although, I am aware of how much journey I've left to cover yet. If you wanna tag along, hey, welcome aboard.
