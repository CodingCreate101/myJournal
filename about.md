Identification can be a tricky thing, sometimes. For simplicity, let's say I am a web-developer. I like playing
around with technology and anything new, really. I am curious about a lot of things which includes life's biggest
questions. That takes me to philosophical areas, which I find very interesting. Admittedly, I don't find many people truly interested in those kinds of stuff; So, I often keep my thoughts to myself or sometimes write about them - some of them are here, on this website.

Other than that, I used to play Table tennis a lot. I haven't played it recently and I would definitely if I get a chance. I liked that game very much.
