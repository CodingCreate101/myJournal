> Tl;dr: I am honest, loving, caring, creative.


~~Identification can be a tricky thing, sometimes. For simplicity, let's say I am a web-developer. I like playing
around with technology and anything new, really. I am curious about a lot of things which includes life's biggest
questions. That takes me to philosophical areas, which I find very interesting. Admittedly, I don't find many people truly interested in those kinds of stuff; So, I often keep my thoughts to myself or sometimes write about them - some of them are here, on this website.~~

<span>I</span>{:class="firstWord"} have asked and re-asked this question myself, who/what am I? This isn't a simple question to me - it is philosophical and existential.

In short, I've found the answer - mostly intellectually and in few occasions, experientially. I've memories and some intuitive understanding of those experiences, hence the answer.

Even with those understandings, of course, journey is far from over. They've only made me aware of how much there is left to cover. If you wanna tag along in this journey, hey, welcome aboard! ;)
