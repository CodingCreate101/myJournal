<p class="poem" style="text-align: center">
Foolish child with no human eyes <br>
What did you expect? <br>
Life should be fair? Creatures be nice? <br>
And know how to act? <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
You primitive mind of a different time <br>
There is no such fantasy <br>
Of blind love and fearless acts <br>
Or superior loyalty<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
These beautiful lies you painfully torn <br>
Of what is what and what is not<br>
Since the day you were born<br>
One at a time, a piece here and there <br>
You have picked yourself apart <br>
I can see your despair <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
There is no room for such infantile thought<br>
Among the gown and the adult <br>
No, grow cold and calculate <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
Purity of mind and soul is nothing to obtain <br>
It's a pointless goal <br>
Be thick skinned and focus like a rifle <br>
Don't trifle. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
Be your own favorite, love yourself <br>
Forget what they teach<br>
Don't expect to be given a treat <br>
Because in this world you are simply meat. <br>
</p>
