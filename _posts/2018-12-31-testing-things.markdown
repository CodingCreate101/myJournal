Just writing this to test everything's working fine. You probably, already know what to expect from this post because you have already read the title. But anyway, I have to continue writing until it's about 3-4 lines so that I get a rough understanding how things look. I have already tested this, of course but this will be a test on production site and I don't want to add Lorem ipsom. Uh, I guess that should be enough.


Let me also try a tiny JS snippet. Hope that works out.

{% highlight js %}
var newVar = 0;
console.log("Log this: " + newVar);
{% endhighlight %}


Oh, it did work properly. I am glad it worked. As you can see, it's a last day of 2018. I have so much to write about 2018; but not right now. I have to host this site now.

Later.
