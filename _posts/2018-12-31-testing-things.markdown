Writing this to test everything's working as expected. You probably know what to expect from this post because you have read the title. But anyway, I have to continue writing until it's about 3-4 lines so that I get a good understanding of how things look on the page. I also don't want to add dummy-text like Lorem ipsom, you know. Uh, I guess that should be enough.


Let me also try a tiny JS snippet while I am at it.

{% highlight js %}

var a = "Hello World";
console.log("Log: " + a);

{% endhighlight %}

Ah, it does work. As you can see, it's a last day of `2018`. I have so much to write about 2018; but not right now. I have to host this site.

Later.
