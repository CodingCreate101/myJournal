    <p>Here I am - writing this at 2am. Why? there is no point. Right now, I want to write about a topic, which I haven’t even decided on. But at 2am, it’s too soon to go to bed for me and too late to start anything new. I don’t like it.</p>

<p>Once the day begins, once again it’s the same morning weather, same old metal gates and rain drops on it. When I stop and observe, they look beautiful. But when I am busy or late, I ignore them. Maybe they were beautiful even then.</p>

<p>I just remembered about the formula that I’ve been working on since.. more than 7 years. The prime numbers! I remember the first time I read about them in my class textbook. They didn’t look all that fancy. Now, I know, I wasn’t ready for them.</p>

<p>Thinking about THIS very thought, everything that everyone told me in my life since my early childhood, every advice that everybody gave me - I probably wasn’t ready for them. Some of them were bad advices, of course, but hey, how do I know? For all I know, <code class="highlighter-rouge">I don't know</code> is the default position.</p>

<p>There is so much (goood) information out there that it makes us take it all for granted. Too much of it makes it look nothing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once, when I was 14, standing on stage, singing prayers for my school assembly, looking at all those people, I asked myself: <code class="highlighter-rouge">"What's the point of all this?"</code>. Probably the first important thought/question I ever had.</p>

<p>Maybe that was the time my whole thinking changed to.. something.. different. That easy, simple-looking question got me thinking. I asked this questions to many friends, in different ways but nobody seemed to understand it and why it was important question. I’ve always imagined, people thought and analyzed things the same way as I did. Looking at people functioning well in their daily lives, I thought they had everything figured out. I thought I was the one with problems. When I realized that wasn’t the case, I felt, honestly, disgusted. I told myself if being like the most is normal, I refuse being normal.</p>

<p>eh, it went all over the place.</p>

<p>The point, I think, is to be aware. To increase awareness. Of ourselves, of surrounding. And I think that’s the point of all this. Making our minds open. Being aware.</p>

<p>Ironically, it’s time to sleep. xD</p>

<p>Later.</p>
